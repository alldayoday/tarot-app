# Oracle's Arcana

### This website was created as a journal for people who read Tarot Cards, to give them a beautiful and welcoming space to maintain their practice. Oracle's Arcana is directly targeted for users who prefer a three card tarot spread, as that is the most common number of cards drawn from the Rider Waite Tarot deck. It is a labor of love, and an invitation to share the gifts of all the diviners in this world.
